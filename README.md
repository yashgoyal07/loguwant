# loguwant

It's a Python package that enables you to log only what you want. It creates logger, using which you can see the logs of
the modules written by you separately.

For this we have to defined log level of root logger and log Level of the modules you write and whose logs you want to
print as environment variables ROOT_LOG_LEVEL and CURRENT_LOG_LEVEL respectively. 

We can also switch this functionality by using LOG_DEPTH environment variable.

# uses

```commandline
export ROOT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export CURRENT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export LOG_DEPTH=current
```

```python
from loguwant import logger

logger = logger.get_logger()


def example_function():
    try:
        print('It is an example function to show working of loguwant package')
        logger.debug(logger.prepare_log('It is an debug log'))
        logger.info(logger.prepare_log('It is an info log'))
        logger.warning(logger.prepare_log('It is an warning log'))
    except Exception as err:
        logger.error(logger.prepare_exception_log('It is an error log'))

```
